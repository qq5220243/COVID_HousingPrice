The add column in the CSV file indicates the Chinese addresses of more than 2,000 diseased communities in 30 cities in February 2020. Because many communities do not have standard English names, the location of the community cannot be accurately located after translation. Chinese addresses will not cause errors in the operation of Geocoding and interpolation algorithms. On the contrary, the Geocoding algorithm based on Baidu Maps API can only accept Chinese parameter input.
